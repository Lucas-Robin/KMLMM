1) introduction to the task
    a) what is image classification
    b) description of the 3 datasets

2) results to compare with
    a) state of the art from the literature
    b) our neural network results

3) multiclass kernel SVM
    a) description of the multiclass strategies
        - the two which are already implented in R
        - our one-against-all approach
        - our tree-based approach
        - do we have more here ?!
    b) parameters
        - explanation how we found parameters (cross-validation etc.)
        - maybe include the most important parameters in the report also
    c) results of the different strategies on all the datasets
        - accuracy rates
        - confusion tables (maybe only for the best results, otherwise we have a lot of confusion tables)

4) conclusions
    a) compare NNs vs. SVMs
    b) maybe we'll have some more conclusions (classes which get confused often, etc)

5) description of the interactive application
    a) what it does
    b) manual how to use it


Once we finished this, we can decide what else to include:
- downsampling images
- adding noise
- rotations
- other multiclass-strategies
- other machine learning techniques (e.g. principal component regression)
